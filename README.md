# SBOM-Homework
<p>
  This project takes a directory with many software projects and retuns a sbom (Software Bill of Material) for all of them. The input required is the sbom.py file and a path to the directory with the software projects.
</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>Needs Python3 and git to clone the project</p>
<h2>How to run the project</h2>
<p>
  Once the project is cloned, just write this in the terminal: <br>
  <li>python3 sbom.py 'path to directory'</li><br>
  If that for some reason does not work try with 'python' instead of 'python3'
</p>
