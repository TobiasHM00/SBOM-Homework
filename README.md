# SBOM-Homework
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>Needs Python3 and git to clone the project</p>
<h2>How to run the project</h2>
<p>
  Once the project is cloned, just write this in the terminal: <br>
  <li>python3 sbom.py 'path to directory with software projects'</li><br>
  If that for some reason does not work try with 'python' instead of 'python3'
